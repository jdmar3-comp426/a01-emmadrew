            <h2>Discrediting Physical Evidence</h2>
            <p>Though many photographs have supposedly recorded this creature in action, most have ultimately been determined to depict other animals or objects. In some cases, the photographed creatures had been entirely fake. Moreover, numerous monster hunters have attempted to locate Nessie, but none have proven successful. Additionally, sonar explorations were used to locate this monster, but none found any creature that matched the size described by viewers.</p>

            <h2>New Science Aids in Investigations</h2>
            <p>In 2018, researchers utilized new DNA technology to conduct a survey of the water in Loch Ness. After rumors speculated that the monster could be a plesiosaur, a long-extinct reptile, scientists sought out to determine whether this was a viable possibility. Unfortunately, DNA evidence did not point to any plesiosaurs or other similarly large reptiles. However, data did suggest that the lake contained many eels, suggesting that this monster could potentially be a gigantuan eel.</p>
