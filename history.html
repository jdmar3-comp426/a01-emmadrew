            <h2>Early Sightings</h2>
            <p>Sightings of this creature date back to the early 300s AD, wherein local stone carvings were created by a people known as the Pict. These carvings, though they cannot be confirmed as depicting the Loch Ness monster, illustrate an unknown beast that has large flippers. The early sightings don't stop there, however. The first written record of this fantastic legend appears in a biography published in the late sixth century; the subject of the work is said to have stopped the Loch Ness monster from attacking a swimmer by ordering it to "go back." It is noteworthy, however, that most of these rumored encounters with the monster can be substantially correlated to tales present in Scottish folklore, which contain many myths surrounding water creatures. The rumors didn't end there. Almost 100 years ago, the rumor of the Loch Ness Monster began to take hold within pop culture. In 1933, a road was developed that ended at the top of the lake, providing both an onobstructed view of the water source and an abundance of opportunities for alleged sightings. One of the first of these encounters was given by a couple that stated they saw a "prehistoric monster" run in front of their car and disappear into the lake. This story was published in a Scottish newspaper, enabling great publicity and further supposed sightings.</p>

            <h2>Trying to Catch the Monster</h2>
            <p>After multiple sightings sent the media into a frenzy, many "monster hunters" became enthralled with trying to catch this creature. One Marmaduke Wetherell was commissioned by the Daily Mail to locate the serpent. He later reported large footprints that he believed to belong to some 20-foot long animal; however, these footprints were eventually determined to be man-made and falsified. Similarly, a famous photo of the monster, later nicknamed the "surgeon's photograph", was supposedly taken by an English physician. Later, the creature seen in the photo was identified as being comprised of a plastic head attached to a submarine.</p>

            <h2>The Loch Ness Monster Today</h2>
            <p>Despite many notable (failed) attempts to locate this creature, this rumor remains popular. It also remains profitable. According to Britannica Encyclopedia, the rumor is thought to have contributed nearly $80 million dollars annually to Scotland's economy by the 21st century.</p>
